## Evaluating Emotional Intelligence

Most large companies today have employed trained psychologists to develop what are known 
as “competency models” to aid them in identifying, training, and promoting likely stars 
in the leadership firmament. The pshychologists have also developed such models for lower-
level positions. And in recent years, I have analyzed competency models from 188 companies.

In carrying out this work, my objective was to determine which personal capabilities 
drove outstanding performance within these organizations, and to what degree they did so.
I grouped capabilities into three categories: purely technical skills like accounting and
business planning; cognitive abilities like analytical reasoning and competencies 
demonstrating emotional intelligence, such as the ability to work with others and 
effectiveness in leading change.

To create some of the competency models, psychologists askked senior managers and the 
companies to identify the capabilities that typified the organization's most outstanding 
leaders. To create other models, the psychologists used objective criteria, such as a 
division's profitability, to differentiate the start performers at senior levels within
their organizations from the average ones. Those individuals were then extensively 
interviewed and tested, and their capabilities were compared. This process resulted in
the creation of lists of ingredients for hightly effective leaders. The lists ranged in 
lenght from seven to 15 items and included such ingredients as initiative and strategic
vision.

### Idea in Brief

What distinguishes great leaders from merely good ones? It isn't IQ or technical skills,
says Daniel Goleman. It's emotional intelligence: a group of five skills that enable the 
best leaders to maximize their own and their followers' performance. When senior managers
at one company had a critical mass of EI capabilities, their divisions outperformed yearly
earnings goals by 20%.

#### The EI skills are:

- Self-awarness - knowing one's strenghts, weaknesses, drives, values and impact on others
- Self-regulation - controlling or redirecting disruptive impulses and moods
- Motivation - relishing achievement for its own sake
- Empathy - understanding other people's emotional makeup
- Social skills - building rapport with others to move them in desired directions

We're each born with certain levels of EI skills. But we can strengthen these abilities
through persistence, practice, and feedback from colleagues or coaches.

When I anazyzed all this data, I found dramatic results. To be sure, intellect was a 
driver of outstanding performance. Cognitive skills such as bit-picture thinking and
long-term vision were particularly important. But when I calculated the ratio of technical
skills, IQ, and emotional intelligence as ingredients of excellent performance, emotional
intelligence proved to be twice as important as the others for jobs at all levels. 

Moreover, my analysis showed that emotional intelligence played an increasingly
important role at the highest levels of the company, where differences in technical skills
are of negligible importance. In other words, the higher the rank of a person considered
to be a star performer, the more emotional intelligence capabilities showed up as the 
reason for his or her effectiveness. When I compared star performers with average ones 
in senior leadership postion, nearly 90% of the difference in their profiles was 
attributable to emotional intelligence factors rather than cognitive abilities. 

### Idea in Practice

#### Understanding EI's Components

| EI Component | Definition | Hallmarks | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Self-awarness | Knowing one's emotions, strenghts, weaknesses, drives, values, and goals - and their impact on others | *Self-confidence *Realistics self-assessment *Self-deprecating sense of humor *Thirst for constructive criticism | A manager knows tight deadlines bring out the worst in him. So he plans his time to get work done well in advance. |
| Self-regulation | Controlling or redirecting disruptive emotions and impulses | * Trustworthiness * Integrity * Comfor with ambiguity and change | When a team botches a presentation, its leader resists the urge to scream. Instead, she considers possible reasons for faliure, explains the consequences to her team, and explores solutions with them. |
Motivation | Being driven to achieve for the sake of achievement | * A passion for the work itself and for new challanges * Unflagging energy to improve | Optimism in the face of failure | A portfolio manager at an investment company sees his fund tumble for three consecutive quaters. Major clients defect. Instead of blaming external circumstances, she decides to learn from the experience - and egineeers a turnaround. |
Empathy | Considering others' feelings, especially when making decisions | * Expertise in attracting and retainig talent * Ability to develop others * Sensitivity to cross-cultural differences | An American consultant and her team pitch a project to a potential client in Japan. Her team interprets the client's silence as disapproval, and prepares to leave. The consultant reads the client's body language and senses interest. She continues the meeting, and her teams gets the job. |
Social Skill | Managing relationships to move people in desired directions | * Effectiveness in leading change * Persuasiveness * Extensive networking * Experience in building and leading teams | A manager wants his company to adopt a better Internet strategy. He finds kindred spirits and assembles a de facto team to create prototype Web site. He persuades allies in other divisions to fund the company's participation in a relevant convention. His company forms an Internet division - and puts him in charge of it. |

### Strengthening Your EI

#### Use practice and feedback from others to strengthen specific EI skills.

Example: An executive learned from others that she lacked empathy, especially the ability
to listen. She wanted to fix the problem, so she asked a coach ot tell her when she 
exhibited poor listening skills. She then role-played incidents to practice giving 
better responses; for example, not interrupting. She also began observing executives 
skilled at listening - and imitated their behaviour.

## The five components of emotional intelligence at work

| | Definition | Hallmarks | 
| -- | -- | -- |
| Self-awarness | The ability to recognize and understand your moods, emotions, and drivers, as well as their effect on others. | Self-confidence Realistic self-assessment Self-deprecating sense of humor |
| Self-regulation | The ability to control or redirect disruptive impulses and moods The propernsity to suspend judgment - to think before acting | Trustworthiness and integrity Comfort with ambiguity Openness to change |
| Motivation | A passion to work for reasons that go beyond money or status A propensity to pursue goals with energy and persistence | Strong drive to achieve Optimism, even in the face of failure Organizational commitment |
| Empathy | The ability to understand the emotional makeup of other people Skill in treating people according to their emotional reactions | Expertise in building and retaining talent Cross-cultural sensitivity Service to clients and customers |
| Social skill | Proficiency in managing relationships and building networks An ability to find common ground and build rapport | Effectiveness in leading change Persuasiveness Expertise in building and leading teams |

Other researches have confirmed that emotional intelligence not only distinguishes 
outstanding leaders but can also be linked to strong performance. The findings of the 
late David McClelland, the renowned researcher in human and organizational behavior, are
a good example. In a 1996 study of a global food and beverage company, McClelland found 
that when senior managers had a critical mass of emotional intellegence capabilities,
their divisions outperformed yearly earnings goals by 20%. Meanwhile, division leaders
Meanwhile, division leaders without that critical mass underperformed by almost the 
same amount. McCelland's findings, interestingly, held as true in the company's U.S. 
division as in its division in Asia and Europe.

In short, the numbers are beginning to tell us a persuasive story about the link between
a complany's success and the emotional intelligence of its leaders. And just as
important, research is also demonstrating that people can, if they take the right approach,
develop their emotional intelligence.

### Self-Awareness

Self-awareness is the first component of emotional intellifence - which makes when one
considers that the Delphic oracle gave the advice to "know yourself" thousands of years
ago. Self-awarness means having a deep understanding of one's emotions, strengths, 
weaknesses, needs, and drives. People with strong self-awarness are neither overly 
critical nor unrealistically hopeful. Rather, they are honest - with themselves and 
with others. 

People who have a high degree of self-awarnesses recognize how their feelings affect
them, others people, and their job performances. Thus, a self-aware person who knows that
tight deadlines bring out the worsk in him plans his time carefully and gets his work
done well in advance. Another person with high self-awarnesses will be able to work with 
a demanding client. She will understand the client's impact on her moods and the deeper
reasons for her frustration. "Their trivial demands take us away from the real work that
needs to be done", she might explain. And she will go one step further and turn her 
answer into something constructive.

## Can Emotional Intellegence Be Learned? 

FOR AGES, PEOPLE HAVE DEBATED if leaders are born or made. So too goes the debate
about emotional intelligence. Are people born with certain levels of empathy, for 
example, or do they acquire empathy as a result of life's experiences? The answer is both.
Scientific inquiry strongly suggests that there is a genetic component to emotional 
intelligence. Psychological and developmental research indicates that nurture plays a 
role as well. How much of each perhaps will never be known, but research and practice 
clearly demonstrate that emotional intelligence can be learned. 

One thing is certain: EI increases with age. There is an old-fashioned word for the
phenomenon: maturity. Yet even with maturity, some people still need training to enhance
their emotional intelligence. Unfortunately, far too many training programs that intend
to build leadership skills - including emotional intelligence - are a waste of time and
money. The problem is simple: They focus on the wrong part of the brain.

EI is born largely in the neurotransmitters of the brain's limbic system, which 
governs feelings, impulses, and drivers. Research indicates that the limbic system learns
best through motivation, extended practice, and feedback. Compare this with the kind of
learning that goes on in the neocortex, which governs analytical and technical ability.
The neocortex grasps concepts and logic. It is the part of the brain that figures out 
how to use a computer or make a sales call by reading a book. Not surprisingly - but 
mistakenly - it is also the part of the brain targeted by most training programs aimed
at enhancing emotional intelligence. When such programs take, in effect, a neocortical
approach, my research with the Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence in 
Organizations has shown they can even have a negative impact on people's job performance.

To enhance emotional intelligence, organizations must refocus their training to 
include the limbic system. They must help people break old behavioral habits and 
establish new ones. That not only takes much more time than conventional training
programs, it also requires and individualized approach.

Imagine an executive who is thought to be low on empathy by her colleagues. Part of 
that deficit shows itself as an inability to listen; she interrupts people and doesn't
pay close attention to what they're saying. To fix the problem, the executive needs
to be motivated to change, and then she needs practice and feedback from others in the
company. A colleague or coach could be tapped to let the executive know then she has been
observed failing to listen. She would then have to replay the incident and give a better
response; that is, demonstrate her ability to absorb what others are saying. And the
executive could be directed to observe certain executives who listen well and to mimic 
their behavior. 

With persistence and practice, such a process can lead to lasteing results. I know one 
Wall Street executive who sought to improve his empathy - specifically his ability to 
read people's reactions and see their perspectives. Before beginning his quest, the 
executive's subordinates were terrified of working with him. People even went so far as
to hide bad news from him. Naturally, he was shocked when finally confronted with these
facts. He went home and told his family - but they only confirmed what he had heard at 
work. When their opinions on any given subject did not mesh with his, they too, were 
frightened of him.

Enlisting the help of a coach, the executive went to work to heighten his empathy through
practice and feedback. His first step was to take a vacation to a foreign country where 
he did not speak the language. While there, he monitored his reactions to the unfamiliar
and his openness to people who were different form him. When he returned home, humbled by
his week abroad, the executive asked his coach to shadow him for parts of the day, several
times a week, to critique how he treated people with new or different perspectives. At the
same time, he consciously used on-the-job interactions as opportutities to practice
"hearing" ideas that differed from him. Finally, the executive had himself videotaped in
meetings and asked those who worked for and with him to critique his ability to 
asknowledge and understand the feelings of others. It took several months, but the 
executive's emotional intelligence did ultimately rise, and the improvement was reflected
in his overall performance on the job.

It's important to emphasize that building one's EI cannot - will not - happen without
sincere desire and concerted effort. A brief seminar won't help; nor can one buy a how-to
manual. It is much harder to learn to empathize - to internalize empathy as a natural 
response to people - than it is to become adept at regression analysis. But it can be done.
"Nothing great was ever archived without enthusiasm," wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson. If your
goar is to become a real reader, these words can serve as a guidepost in your efforts to
develop high emotional intelligence.

Self-awarness extends to a person's understanding of his or her values and goals. Someone
who is highly self-aware knows where he is headed and why; so, for example, he will be
able to be firm in turning down a job offer that is tempting financially but does not fit
with his principles or long-term goals. A person who lacks self-awareness is apt to make
decisions that bring on inner turmoil by treading on buried values. "The money looked 
good so I signed on," someone might say two years into a job, "but the work means so 
little to me that I'm constantly bored." The decisions of self-aware people mesh with
their values; consequently, they often find work to be energizing.

How can one recognize self-awarness? First and foremost it shows itself as candor and an
ability to assess oneself realistically. People with high self-awarness are able to speak
accurately and openly - althrough not necessarily effusively or confessionally - about 
their emotions and the impact they have on their work. For instance, one manager I know of
was skeptical about a new personal-shopper service that her company, a major department-
store chain, was about to introduce. Without promping from her team or her boss, she 
offered them an explanation: "It's hard for me to get behind the rollout of this service,"
she admitted, "because I really wanted to run the project, but I wasn't selected. Bear
with me while I deal with that." The manager did indeed examine her feelings; a week later,
she was supporting the project fully. 

Such self-knowledge often shows itself in the hiring process. Ask a candidate to describe
a time he got carried away by his feelings and did something he later regretted. Self-aware
candidates will be frank in admitting to failure - and will often tell their tales with
a smile. One of the hallmarks of self-awareness is a self-deprecating sense of humour.

Self-awarness can also be indentified during performance reviews. Self-aware people know-
and are comfortable talking about - their limitations and strengths, and they often 
demonstrate a thirst for constructive criticism. By contrast, people with low self-
awarness interpret the messages that they need to improve as a threat or a signal of
failure.

Self-aware people can also be recognized by their slef-confidence. They have a firm grasp
of their capabilities and are less likely to set themselves up to a fail by, for example,
overstretching on assignments. They know, too, when to ask for help. And the risks they
take on the job are calculated. They won't ask for a challenge that they know can't handle
alone. They'll play to their strenghts.

Consider the actions of a midlevel employee who was invited to sit in on a strategy 
meeting with her company's top executives. Although she was the most junior person in the
room, she did not sit there quietly, listening in awestruck of fearful silence. She knew
she had a head for clear login and the skill to present ideas percuasively, and she 
offered cogent suggestions aobut the company's strategy. At the same time, her self-
awarness stopped her from wandering into territory where she knew she was weak.

Despite the value of having self-aware people in the workplace, my research indicates 
that senior executives don't often give self-awarness the credit it deserves when they
look for potential leaders. Many executives mistake candor about feelings for "wimpiness"
and fail to give due respect to employees who openly acknowledge their shortcomings. Such
people are too readily dismissed as "not tough enought" to lead others.

In fact, the opposite is true. In the first place, people generally admire and respect 
candor. Furthermore, leaders are constantly required to make judgment calls that require
to make judgment calls that require a candid assessment of capabilities - their own and 
those of others. Do we have the management expertise to acquire a competitor? Can we 
launch a new product within six months? People who assess themselves honeslty - that is, 
self-aware people - are well sited to do the same for the organization they run.

## Self-Regulation

Biological impulses drive our emorions. We cannot do away with them - but we can do much 
to manage them. Self-regulation, which is like a ongoing inner conversation, is the
component of emotional intelligence that frees us from being prisoners of our feelings. 
People engaged in such a converation feel bad moods and emotional impulses as everyone 
else does, but they find ways to control them and even to channel them in useful ways.

Imagine an executive who has just watched a team of his employees present a botched
analysis to the company's board of directors. In the gloom that follows, the executive
might find himself tempted to pound on the table in anger of kick over a chair. He could
leap up and scream at the group. Or he might maintain a grim silence, glaring at everyone
before stalking off.

But if he had a gift for self-regulation, he would choose a different approach. He would
pick his words carefully, asknowledging the team's poor performance without rushing to 
any hasty judgment. He would then step back to consider the reasons for the failure. Are
they personal - a lack of effort? Are there any mitigating factors? What was his role in
the debacle? After considering these questions, he would call team together, lay out the
incident's consequences, and offer his feelings aobut it. He would then present his 
analysis of the problem and well-considered solution.

Why does self-regulation matter so much for leaders?
First of all, people who are in control of their feelings and impulses - that is, people
who are reasonable - are able to create an environment of trust and fairness. In such an
environment, politics and infighting are sharply reduced and productivity is high. Talented
people flock to the organization and aren't temted to leave. And self-regulation has a 
trickle-down effect. No one wants to be known as a hothead when the boss is known for her
calm approach. Fewer bad moods at the top means fewer throughout the organization.

Second, self-regulation is important for competitive reasons. Everyone knows that business
today is a rife with ambiguity and change. Companies merge and breat apart regularly. 
Thechnology transforms work at a dizzying pace. People who have mastered their emotions 
are able to roll with the changes. When a new program is announced, they don't panic; 
instead, they are able to suspend judgment, seek out information, and listen to the 
executives as they explain the new program. As the initiative moves forward, these people
are able to move with it.

Sometimes they even lead the way. Consider the case of a manager at a large manufacturing 
company. Like her colleagues, she had used a certain software program for five years. The
program drove how she collected and reported data and how she thought about the company's
strategy. One day, senior executives announced that a new program was to be installed that
would radically change how information was gathered and assessed within the organization. 
While many people in the company complained bitterly about thos disruprive the change 
would be, the manager mulled over the reason for the new program and was convinced of its
potential to improve performance. She eagerly attended trainig session - some of ther
collegues refused to do so - nd was eventually promoted to run several divisions, in part
because she used the new technology so effectively.

I want to push the importance of self-regulation to leadership even furthere and make the 
case that it enhances integrigyt, which is not only a personal virtue but also an
organizational strenght. Many of the bad things that happen in companies are a funciton of
impulsive behaviour. People rarely plan to exaggerate profits, pad expense accounts, dip
into the till, or abuse power for selfish ends. Instead, and opportunity presents itself,
and people with low impulse control just say yes.

By contrast, consider the behaviour of the senior executive at a large food company. The
executive was scrupulously honest in his negotiations with local distributors. He would 
routinely lay out his cost structure in detail, thereby giving the distributors a realistic
understanding of the company's pricing. This approach meant the executive couldn't always
drive a hard bargain. Now, on occasion, he felt the urge to increase profits by withholding
information about the company's costs. But the challenged that impulse - he saw that it 
made more sense in the long run to cunteract it. His emotional self-regulation paid off in
strong, lasting releationships with distributors that benefited the company more than any
short-term financial gains would have.

The signs of emotional self-regulation, therefore, are easy to use: a propensity for 
reflection and thoughtfulness; comfort with ambiguity and change; and integrity - an
ability to say no to impulsive urges. 

Like self-awarness, self-regulation often does not get its due. People who can master 
their emotions are sometimes seen as cold fish - thieri considered responses are taken as
a lack of passion. People with fiery temperaments are frequently thought of a "classic" 
leaders - their otbursts are considered hallmarks of charisma and power. But when such 
people make it to the top, their impulsiveness often works agains them. In my research, 
extreame displays of negative emotion have never emerged as a driver of good leadership.

## Motivation

If there is one trait that virtually all effective leaders have, it is motivation. They 
are driven to achieve beyond expectations - their own and everyone else's. The key word
here is achieve. Plenty of people are motivated by external factors, such as a big salary
or the status that comes from having an impressive title or being part of a prestigious 
company. By contrast, those with leadership potential are motivated by a deeply embedded
desire to achieve for the aske of achievement. 

If you are looking for leaders, how can you identify people who are motivated by the drive
to achieve rathere than by external rewards? The first sign is a passion for the work 
itself - such people seek out creative challenges, love to learn, and take great pride in
a job well done. They aslo display an unflagging energy to do this better. People with such
energy often seem restless with the status quo. They are persistent with their questions
about why things are done one way rather than anothere; they are eager to explore new 
approaches to their work. 

A cosmetic company manger, for example, was frustrated that he had to wait two weeks to 
get sales results from people in the field. He finally tracked down an automated phone
system that would beep each of his salespeople at 5p.m. every day. An automated message 
then prompted them to punch in their numbers - how many calls and sales they had made that
day. The system shortened the feedback time on sales results from weeks to hours. 

That story illustrates two other common thaits of people who are driven to achieve. They
are forever rasing the performance bar, and they like to tkeep score. Take the performace
bar first. During performance reviews, people with high levels of motivation might as to
be "stretched" by their superiors. Of course, an employee who combines self-awareness
with internal motivation will recognize her limits - but she won't settle for objectives
that seem too easy to fulfill.

And it follows naturally that people who are driven to do better also want a way of 
tracking process - their own, their team's, and their company's. Whereas people with low
achivements motivation are often fuzzy about results, those with high achievemnt motivation
often keep score by tracking such hard measures as profitability or market share. I know
of a money manager who starts and ends his day on the Internet, gaugin the performance of
his stock fund against four industry-set benchmarks.

Interestingly, people with high motivation remain oprimistic even when the score is aginst
them. In such cases, self-regulation combines with achievement motivation to oevercome the 
frustratrion and depression that come after a setback or failure. Thake the case of 
another portfolio manager at ta large investment company. After several successful years, 
her fund tumbled for three consecutive quarters, leading three large institutional clients
to shift their business elsewhere. 

Some executives would have blamed the nosedive on circumstances outside their control;
others might have seen the setback as evidence of persolan failure. This portfolio manager,
however, saw an opportunity to prove she could lead a turaround. Two years later, when she
was promoted to a very senior level in the company, she described the experience as " the
best thing that ever happened to me; I learned so much form it."

Executives trying to recognize high levels of achievemtn motivation in their people can
look for one last of evidence: commitment to the organization. When people love their 
jobs for the work itself, they often feel committed to the organizations that make that
work possible. Commited employees are likely to stay with an organization even when they
are pursued by headhunters waving money.

it's not difficult to understand how and why a motivation to achieve translates into 
strong leaderhisp. If you set the performance bar high to yourself, you will do the same
for the organization when you are in a position to do so. Likewise, a drive to surpass 
goal and an interest in keeping score can be contagious. Leaders with these traits can 
often build a team of managers around them with the same traits. And of course, optimistm
and organizational commitment are fundamental to leadership - just try to imagine running
a company without them.

## Empathy

Of all the dimensions of emotional intelligence, empathy is the most easily recognized. 
We have all felt the empathy of a sensitive teacher or friend; we have all been struck by
its absence in an unfeeling coach or boss. But when it comes to business, we rarely hear
people praised, let alone rewarded, for their empathy. The very word seems unbusinesslike,
out of place amid the tough realities of the marketplace.

But empathy doesn't mean a kind of "I'm OK, you're OK" mushiness. For a leader, that is,
it doesn't mean adopting other people's emotions as one's own and trying to please
everybody. That would be a nightmare - it would make action impossible. Rather, empathy
means thoughtfully considering employees' feelings - along with other factors - in the
process of making intelligent decisions. 

For an example of empathy in action, consider what happened when two giant brokerage
companies merged, creating redundant jobs in all their divisions. One division manager
called his people together and gave a gloomy speech that emphasized the number of people
who would soon be fired. The manager of another division gave his people a differnt kind
of speech. He ws up-front about his own worry and confusion, and he promised to keep
people informed and to treat everyone fairly. 

The difference between these two mangers was empathy. The first manager was too worried
about his own fate to consider the feelings of his anxiety-stricken colleagues. The second
knew intuitively what his people were feeling, and he asknowledged their fears with his 
words. Is it any surprise that the first manger saw his division sink as many demoralized
people, especially the most talanted, departed? By conrtast, the second manager
continued to be a strong leader, his best people stayed, and his division remained
as producitve as ever.

Empathy is particularly important today as a component of leadership for at least
three reasons: the increasing use of teams; the rapid place of globalization; and 
the growing need to retain talent.

Consider the challenge of leading a team. As anyone who has ever been a part of
one can attest, teams are cauldrons of bubbling emotions. They are often charged
with reaching a consensus - which is hard enough with two people and much more
difficult as the numbers increase. Even in groups with as few as four or fice 
members, alliances form and clashing agendas get set. A team's leader must be
able to sense and understand the viewpoints of everyone around the table.

That's exactly what a marketing manger at a large information technology company
was able to do when she was appointed to lead a troubled team. The group was in
turmoil, overloaded by work and missing deadlines. Tensions were high among the
members. Thinkering with procedures was not enough to bring the group together
and make it an effective part of the company.

So the manger took several steps. In a series of one-on-one sessions, she took
the time to listen to everyone in the groupw - what was frustrating them, how
they rated their collegues, whether they felt they had been ignored. And then she
directed the team in a way that brought it togethere: She encouraged people to
speak more openly about their frustrations, and she helped people raise constructive
complains during meetings. In short, her empathy allowed her to understand her
team's emotional makeup. The result was not just heightened collaboration among
members but also added business, as the team was called on for help by a wider
range of internal clients.

Globalization is another reason for the rising importance of empathy for business
leaders. Cross-cultural dialogue can easily lead to miscues and misunderstandings.
Empathy is an antidote. People who have it are attunded to subtletise in body
language; they can hear the message beneath the words being spoken. Beyond that,
they have a deep understanding of both the existence and the importance of cultural
and ethnic differences.

Consider the case of an American consultant whose team had just pitched a project 
to a potential Japanese client. In its dealings with Americans, the team was 
accustomed to being bombarded with question after such a proposal, but this time
it was greeted with a long silence. Other members of the team, taking the silence
as disapproval, were ready to pack and leave. The lead consultant gestured them 
to stop. Although he was not practicarly familiar with Japanese culture, he read
the client's face and posture and sensed not rejection but interest - even deep
consideration. He was right: When the client finally spoke, it was to give the
consulting firm the job.

Finally, empathy plays a key role in the retention of talent, particularly in
today's information economy. Leaders have always needed empathy to develop and
keep good people, but today the stakes are higher. When good people leave, they
take the company's knowledge with them.

That's where coaching and mentoring come in. It has repeatedly been shown that
coaching and mentoring pay off not just in better performance but also in 
increased job satisfaction and decreased turnover. But what makes coaching and
mentoring work best is the nature of the relationships. Outstanding coaches and
mentors get inside the heads of the people they are helping. They sense how to 
give effective feedback. They know when to push for better performance and when
to hold back. In the way they motivate their proteges, they demonstrate empathy
in action.

In what is probably sounding like a refrain, let me repeat that empathy doesn't
get much respect in business. People wonder how leaders can make hard decisions
if they are "feeling" for all the people who will be affected. But leaders with
empathy do more than sympathize with people around them: They use their knowledge
to improve their companies in subtle but important ways.

## Social Skill

The first three components of emotional intelligence are self-management skills.
The last two, empathy and social skill, concern a person's ability to manage 
relationships with oters. As a component of emotional intelligence, social skill
is not as simple as it sounds. It's not just a matter of friendliness, although
people with high levels of social skill are rarely mean-spirited. Social skill,
rather, is friendliness with a purpose: moving people in the direction you desire,
whether that's agreement on a new marketing strategy or enthusiasm about a new 
product. 

Socially skilled people tend to have a wide circle of acquaintances, and they have
a knack for finding common group with people of all kinds - a knack for building
rapport. That doesn't mean they socialize continually; it means they work
according to the assumption that nothing important gets done alone. Such people 
have a network in place when the time for action comes.

Social skills is the culmination of the other dimentions of emotional intelligence.
People tend to be very effective at managing relationships when they can 
undrerstand and control their own emotions and can empathize with the feelings
of others. Even motivation contributes to social skill. Remember that people who
are driven to achieve tend to be optimistic, even in the face of setbacks or failure.
When people are upbeat, their "glow" is sast upon conversations and other social
encounters. The are popular, and for good reason. 

Because it is the outcome of the other dimensions of emotional intelligence, 
social skill is recognizable on the job in many ways that will by now sound 
familiar. Socially skilled people, for instance, are adept at managing teams -
that's their empathy at work. Likewise, they are expert persuaaders - a 
manifestation of self-awareness, self-regulation, and empathy combined. Gieven
those skills, good persuaders know when to make an emotional plea, for instance,
and when an appeal to reason will work better. And motivation, when publicly
visible, makes such people excellent collaborators; their passion for the work
spreads to thers, and they are driven to find solutions.

But sometimes social skill show itself in ways the other EI components do not. For
instance, socially skilled people may at times appear not to be working while at
work. They seem to be idly schmoozing - chatting in the hallways with colleagues
or joking around with people who are not even connected to their "real" jobs.
Socially skilled people, however, don't think it makes sense to arbitrarily limit
the scope of their relationships. They build bonds widely becaue they know that
in these fluid times, they may need help someday from people they are just getting
to know today.

For example, consider the case of an executive in the strategy department of a 
global computer manufacturer. By 1993, he was convinced that the company's future
lay with the Internet. Over the course of the next year, he found kindred spirits
and used his social skill to stich together a virtual community that cut across
level, divisions, and nations. He then used this de facto team to put up a
corporate Web site, among the first by a major company. And, on his own initiative,
with no budget or formal status, he signed up the company to participate in an
annual Internet industry convention. 

Calling on his allies and persuading various divisions to donate funds, he 
recruited more than 50 people from a dozen different units to represent the 
company at the convention. 

Management took notice: Within a year of the conference, the executive's team
formed the basis for the company's first Internet division, and he was formally
put in charege of it. To get there, the executive had ignored conventional 
boundaries, forging and maintaining connections with people in every corner of
the organization.

Is social skill considered a key leadership capability in most companies? The answer is yes, especially when copared with the other components of EI. People seem to know intuitively that leaders need to manage relationships effectively; no leader in an island.
After all, the leader's task is to get work done through other people, and social skill 
makes that possible. A leader who cannot express her empathy may as well not have
it at tall. And a leader's motivation will be useless if he cannot communicate his
passion to the organization. Social skill allows leaders to put their emotional
intelligence to work. 

It would be foolish to assert that good-old-fashioned IQ and technicall ability
are not important ingredients in strong leadership. But the recipe world not be 
complete without emotional intelligence. It was once thought that the components 
of EI were "nice to have" in business leaders. But now we know that, for the sake
of performace, these are ingredients that leaders "need to have."

It is fortunate, then, that EI can be learned. The process in not easy. It takes
time and, most of all, commitment. But the benefits that comes from having a well-
developed EI, both for the individuals and for the organization, make it worth the
effort.
